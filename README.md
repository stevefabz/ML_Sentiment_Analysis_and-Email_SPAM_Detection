# ML_Sentiment_Analysis_and-Email_SPAM_Detection

Sentiment Analysis and Classification Model for Email Spam Detection:

This project centers on crafting a sentiment analysis and classification model tailored for email spam detection. Employing natural language processing techniques, the model discerns between legitimate (ham) and spam emails with high accuracy. By scrutinizing email content and sentiment, potential spam is effectively filtered, bolstering email security and user experience. The methodology involves feature engineering, encompassing text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and machine learning algorithms like support vector machines or neural networks.
